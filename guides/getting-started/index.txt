Welcome to RubyMotion
=====================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>


Thank you for purchasing RubyMotion. This guide will help you get started with the product.

Overview
--------

http://www.rubymotion.com[RubyMotion] is a toolchain that permits the development of iOS and OSX applications using the Ruby programming language.

http://www.apple.com/ios[iOS] is Apple's mobile operating system, powering a variety of devices such as the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. http://www.apple.com/osx[OSX] is Apple's desktop operating system, powering Mac computers such as the iMac or the MacBook Air.

Developers can write applications for iOS and OSX and submit them to the App Store, Apple's application distribution system.

Conceptually, RubyMotion is a combination of two major components:

* *Runtime*: A brand-new implementation of the Ruby language, tightly integrated with the native Apple runtime and optimized for embedded iOS device constraints.
* *Project Management*: A command-line interface to create, manage, and interactively develop RubyMotion projects. It also includes a static compiler that compiles Ruby into optimized machine code and an interactive console where you can evaluate expressions on the fly and change the way your app behaves in real-time.

RubyMotion installs itself into '/Library/RubyMotion'. A symbolic link to the command-line interface is created as '/usr/bin/motion'.

Prerequisites
-------------

RubyMotion requires a Mac running OSX 10.6 or higher. OSX 10.7 Lion however is highly recommended.

You will need to install the iOS and OSX SDK on your machine. These days the SDKs comes with Xcode. Xcode can be downloaded and installed for free using the App Store application.

NOTE: Xcode is Apple's IDE. You do not need to use it when programming with RubyMotion, you can keep using your favorite text editor.

Open the 'App Store' application then search for "Xcode" in the search field.

Find 'Xcode' from the result, then click on it.

That should open a new page where you can download Xcode. 

Once Xcode is installed, you will need to install the Command Line Tools package, required by RubyMotion.

Open the 'Xcode' application from your 'Applications' folder, then go to the 'Preferences' window and click on the 'Downloads' tab. You should see the 'Command Line Tools' package in this list, make sure to hit the 'Install' button.

Okay, you should be all set now! You can close Xcode.

If you happened to have an older version of Xcode installed on your machine before you installed a newer Xcode from the App Store, you may want to type the following command in order to properly set up the default Xcode path.

----
$ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
----

Software Updates
----------------

Software updates can be applied via the command-line.

The following command will grab the latest version of RubyMotion from the network and install it. You must be connected to the Internet to successfully update RubyMotion.

----
$ sudo motion update
----

You can run the following command to check the version of RubyMotion installed on your computer.

----
$ motion -v
1.0
----

Once a day, the RubyMotion build system pings the software update server in order to see if a new version of RubyMotion is available to install.

If a new version is available RubyMotion prints a message to your terminal suggesting that you to upgrade. The build system will also print a message if your license is about to expire.

Support
-------

If you are experiencing an issue, would like to request a feature, or simply have a question, you can file a support ticket from the command-line too.

----
$ motion support
----

This will open a new window in your browser where you can fill up a support ticket. Your license key and some useful information regarding your environment will be added automatically.

Hello World
-----------

iOS
~~~

We are now ready to write our first RubyMotion iOS program: Hello World.

Open your terminal and go to a place where you would like this first project to be created, then type the following command.

----
$ motion create Hello
----

This command will create a RubyMotion project in a new directory named Hello. If this directory already exists or cannot be created, the command will fail.

Let's have a look inside.

----  
$ cd Hello
$ ls
Rakefile app resources spec
----

A RubyMotion project is +Rakefile+-based. +rake+ is the de-facto Ruby build program. It is similar to +make+ and it ships with Mac OS X by default.

The 'app' directory contains the application code. The 'resources' directory will eventually contain the resource files of your project, such as icon, image or sound files. The 'spec' directory contains specification/test files.

Let's run the default task.

----
$ rake
----

This should build our project then start the simulator, and you should see... an empty, black window. It's actually normal, we haven't written any code yet!

If you look inside the 'app' directory you will see an 'app_delegate.rb' file, which is created by default. This file implements the AppDelegate class, which is responsible for controlling your application.

----
class AppDelegate
  def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)
    true
  end
end
----

Open the 'app/app_delegate.rb' file with your favorite editor. We will change the code to do something more interesting, such as triggering an alert.

----
class AppDelegate
  def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)
    alert = UIAlertView.new
    alert.message = "Hello World!"
    alert.show
    true
  end
end
----

If you run the +rake+ command again from the terminal you should be able to see the alert in the simulator.

Now, let's try this outside the simulator. Make sure you have an iOS device properly configured for development connected over USB, and type the following.

----
$ rake device
----

This should install the Hello app on your device. You can now pick it up and run the app, and you should be able to see the alert message.

Congratulations, you successfully created your first RubyMotion program. That wasn’t too hard, was it?

OSX
~~~

Now, let's try to write our first RubyMotion OSX program. It will also be Hello World.

Open your terminal and go to a place where you would like this first project to be created, then type the following command.

----
$ motion create --template=osx Hello
----

NOTE: Please note that we are passing the +--template=osx+ option to the +motion+ command here. By default, +motion create+ will create iOS projects. Since we want to create an OSX project, we need to select the OSX project template.

This command will create a RubyMotion OSX project in a new directory named Hello. If this directory already exists or cannot be created, the command will fail.

Let's have a look inside.

----  
$ cd Hello
$ ls
Rakefile app resources spec
----

A RubyMotion project is +Rakefile+-based. +rake+ is the de-facto Ruby build program. It is similar to +make+ and it ships with Mac OS X by default.

The 'app' directory contains the application code. The 'resources' directory will eventually contain the resource files of your project, such as icon, image or sound files. The 'spec' directory contains specification/test files.

If you look inside the 'app' directory you will see an 'app_delegate.rb' file, which is created by default. This file implements the AppDelegate class, which is responsible for controlling your application.

----
class AppDelegate
  def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)
    buildMenu
    buildWindow
  end
end
----

Open the 'app/app_delegate.rb' file with your favorite editor. We will change the code to do something more interesting, such as triggering an alert.

----
class AppDelegate
  def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)
    buildMenu
    buildWindow

    alert = NSAlert.new
    alert.messageText = "Hello World!"
    alert.runModal
  end
end
----

If you run the +rake+ command again from the terminal you should be able to see the alert in the simulator.

Congratulations, you successfully created your first RubyMotion iOS and OSX programs. That wasn’t too hard, was it?

And Now?
--------

You will find sample code for both iOS and OSX in the https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples[Sample Code Repository] on GitHub. Each of the sub-folders contains a RubyMotion project as introduced above. You can type +rake+ in each directory to build and run them and check their source code by reading the files in the 'app' directory.

Make sure to check the link:/developer-center[Developer Center] for more resources, such as guides, articles and screencasts.
