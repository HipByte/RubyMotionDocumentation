Submit RubyMotion Apps to TestFlight
====================================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>

In this article we will cover how you can submit development builds of your RubyMotion apps to http://testflightapp.com[TestFlight].

Synopsis
--------

TestFlight is a platform that you can use to distribute development builds of your apps to you team members. You receive feedback, console logs and crash reports automatically. It can be very useful during the development cycle of an app.

You can create an account on http://testflightapp.com[http://testflightapp.com]. It's free.

Installation
------------

We recommend the use of the +motion-testflight+ gem which provides a seamless experience.

----
$ gem install motion-testflight
----

The source code of the +motion-testflight+ gem lives on the http://github.com/HipByte/motion-testflight[HipByte/motion-testflight] GitHub repository.

Unpack the SDK
--------------

You will need to download the TestFlight SDK package from http://testflightapp.com/sdk/download and unpack it into the 'vendor' directory of your RubyMotion project.

The directory structure you need is this:

----
$ ls vendor/TestFlight
README.txt			libTestFlight.a
TestFlight.h			release_notes.txt
----

Change your project configuration
---------------------------------

You will need to change the 'Rakefile' of your project in order to set up the gem.

First, you need to require the gem. Add the following line at the beginning of the file, right after the other +require+ statements:

----
require 'motion-testflight'
----

Now that the gem is loaded, it's time to configure it. Inside your application configuration block, add the following lines:

----
app.testflight.sdk = 'vendor/TestFlight'
app.testflight.api_token = '<insert your API token here>'
app.testflight.team_token = '<insert your team token here>'
----

You can retrieve the values for +api_token+ and +team_token+ from your TestFlight account page.

Optionally, you can use the +distribution_lists+ key if you do want to set up a distribution list for your submissions.

----
app.testflight.distribution_lists = ['CoolKids']
----

Usage
-----

You will see that a new rake task is available, +rake testflight+, which will automatically submit a development build of your app to TestFlight.

The +notes+ argument must be provided; its content will be the actual release notes for the submission.

----
$ rake testflight notes='zomg!'
----
