Use CocoaPods Dependencies in RubyMotion Apps
=============================================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>

In this article we will cover how you can integrate the http://cocoapods.org[CocoaPods] dependency manager inside your RubyMotion project.

Synopsis
--------

CocoaPods is the dependency manager for Objective-C projects. It is similar to RubyGems and Bundler, but for Objective-C dependencies.

Dependencies in CocoaPods are called Pods. You can get the list of available Pods available and more information from http://cocoapods.org.

CocoaPods was originally designed to be integrated in Objective-C Xcode projects, but we worked with the awesome CocoaPods author to make it possible to be used in RubyMotion projects.

Installation
------------

First, you will need to install and setup CocoaPods. Please refer to the http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation[installation guide] on how to install CocoaPods, then run:

----
$ pod setup
----

The http://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods[RubyMotion CocoaPods integration] also comes as a gem and can be installed as follows:

----
$ gem install motion-cocoapods
----

Usage
-----

You will need to require the gem inside the 'Rakefile' of your project.

----
require 'rubygems'
require 'motion-cocoapods'
----

Once you do that, you can simply use the +pods+ method of the application configuration object to describe the Pods you want to require, by using the same expressions as you would do in a regular Podfile.

For instance, if you want to make use of the +AFNetworking+ Pod:

----
Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  # ...
  app.pods do
    pod 'AFNetworking'
  end
end
----

Then you only need to tell your project to run the CocoaPods integration which will download the sources and configure your project to include +AFNetworking+ on the next build:

----
$ rake pod:install
----

Now when you build your project, the +AFNetworking+ sources will be built and linked against your application executable:

----
$ rake
     Build ./build/iPhoneSimulator-7.1-Development
     Build ./vendor/Pods/Pods.xcodeproj [AFNetworking - Release]
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFHTTPRequestOperation.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFHTTPRequestOperationManager.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFHTTPSessionManager.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/UIKit+AFNetworking/AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFNetworkReachabilityManager.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFSecurityPolicy.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFURLConnectionOperation.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFURLRequestSerialization.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFURLResponseSerialization.m
   Compile ./vendor/Pods/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/AFURLSessionManager.m
      Link ./vendor/Pods/.build/libPods-AFNetworking.a
     Build ./vendor/Pods/Pods.xcodeproj [Pods - Release]
      Link ./vendor/Pods/.build/libPods.a
