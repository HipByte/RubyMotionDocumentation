Writing Ruby gems for RubyMotion
================================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>

RubyMotion projects can be extended through the use of RubyGems, the Ruby de-facto packaging system. This article will cover how to write RubyMotion-specific gems.

This article was inspired by http://reality.hk/posts/2012/05/22/create-gems-for-rubymotion[Create gems for RubyMotion], by Francis Chong.

Getting started
---------------

RubyMotion being a statically-built flavor of the Ruby language, existing Ruby gems will not work out of the box in RubyMotion. RubyMotion gems need to be specifically architectured for RubyMotion itself.

In RubyMotion, gems are required in a project's 'Rakefile' and are responsible to extend the project's configuration, for instance by adding files to the project or introducing new settings or +rake+ tasks.

In this article we will work with the fictional +foo+ gem, which has the following file tree.

----
foo.gemspec
lib
  foo.rb
----

The +foo+ gem can be used in a RubyMotion project simply by requiring it in its 'Rakefile'.

----
$:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
require 'motion/project'

require 'rubygems'
require 'foo'

# ...
----

NOTE: the +require "rubygems"+ line is not necessary if you use Ruby 1.9.

The +foo.rb+ file is the entry point of the gem.  It is a good idea to protect this file from being required outside RubyMotion, by adding the following code.

----
unless defined?(Motion::Project::Config)
  raise "This file must be required within a RubyMotion project Rakefile."
end
----

Adding source files
-------------------

A Gem can add files to a RubyMotion project, simply by opening the +Motion::Project::App+ block and append their paths to the +app.files+ variable.

As an example, let's assume the +foo+ gem has a bunch of files under the 'lib/foo' directory that are intended to be mixed in a RubyMotion project.

----
foo.gemspec
lib
  foo.rb
  foo
    foo-model.rb
    foo-view.rb
    foo-controller.rb
----

The 'lib/foo.rb' file can be modified as such.

----
unless defined?(Motion::Project::Config)
  raise "This file must be required within a RubyMotion project Rakefile."
end

Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  Dir.glob(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'foo/*.rb')).each do |file|
    app.files.unshift(file)
  end
end
----

The 'foo-model.rb', 'foo-view.rb' and 'foo-controller.rb' files will be compiled and used by the build system before any other files in the project.

Adding dependencies
-------------------

The +foo+ gem is not limited to adding source files. Since it has access to the +Motion::Project::Config+ object, it has access to the same set of project settings a RubyMotion project does.

For instance, we can assume that our +foo+ gem comes with Objective-C source code.

----
foo.gemspec
lib
  foo.rb
  ...
vendor
  native-foo
    native-foo-model.{m,h}
    native-foo-view.{m,h}
    native-foo-controller.{m,h}
----

This code requires the +CoreData+ framework to be linked with the app.

We can change the 'foo.rb' file accordingly to vendor the native code and set a framework dependency.

----
unless defined?(Motion::Project::Config)
  raise "This file must be required within a RubyMotion project Rakefile."
end

Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  Dir.glob(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'foo/*.rb')).each do |file|
    app.files.unshift(file)
  end
  app.vendor_project(File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/native-foo')), :static)
  app.frameworks += ['CoreData']
end
----

Adding +rake+ tasks
-------------------

A RubyMotion gem can also very easily extend the build system to introduce new +rake+ tasks. 

Since the 'foo.rb' file is required within the RubyMotion project 'Rakefile', it's just a matter of defining the tasks there.

As an example, let's define the +foo+ task which would connect to an imaginary service.

----
unless defined?(Motion::Project::Config)
  raise "This file must be required within a RubyMotion project Rakefile."
end

Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  ...
end

desc "Submit your code to the foo service"
task :foo do
  ...
end
----
