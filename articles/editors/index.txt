Setting up your editor to work with RubyMotion
==============================================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>

RubyMotion was designed so that developers do not need to switch to a particular editor or IDE in order to use it and can simply keep using the text editor they already know and love.

This article covers the text editors that provide support for RubyMotion. We try to keep this article up-to-date following the contributions from the community.

RubyMine
--------

http://http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/[RubyMine] is a commercial IDE for Ruby built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA platform.

It is at the time of this writing the best environment to work with RubyMotion. RubyMine features context-based auto-completion, point-and-click debugging (on both the simulator and the device), inline documentation, and so on.

Please refer to the http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/RUBYDEV/Getting+Started+with+RubyMotion[Getting Started with RubyMotion] guide on JetBrains' developer website for more information.

TextMate
--------

http://macromates.com/[TextMate] is a popular editor on OS X.

A https://github.com/libin/RubyMotion.tmbundle[RubyMotion.tmbundle] plugin is available. It provides code completion and an integration with the build system. It is developed by https://github.com/libin[Libin Pan] and https://github.com/berklee[Berklee].

Sublime Text
------------

http://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime Text] is a relatively new editor for OS X, Windows and Linux that is gaining a lot of interest.

https://github.com/haraken3/SublimeRubyMotionBuilder[SublimeRubyMotionBuilder] is a plugin that provides code completion and an integration with the build system. It is developed by https://github.com/haraken3[Kentaro Hara].

Redcar
------

http://redcareditor.com/[Redcar] is an Open Source editor written in Ruby.

https://github.com/kattrali/redcar-rubymotion[redcar-rubymotion] is a plugin that integrates the RubyMotion workflow in Redcar. All features of RubyMotion are integrated. It is developed by https://github.com/kattrali[Delisa Mason].

Vim
---

http://www.vim.org/[Vim] is the most popular clone of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi[vi]. Vim ships in OS X. http://code.google.com/p/macvim/[MacVim] is a flavor of Vim for OS X that runs outside the terminal.

The builtin +rake ctags+ task can be used to generate a +tags+ file containing all the APIs the project can call into. This file can then be used to automatically complete API calls in the editor. RubyMotion uses http://ctags.sourceforge.net/[Exuberant Ctags]. Ctags is a format understood by a variety of text editors, Vim included.

Better auto-completion can be provided by using the https://github.com/rcyrus/snipmate-snippets-rubymotion[snipmate-snippets-rubymotion] plugin, courtesy of https://github.com/rcyrus[Rajeev Cyrus].

Emacs
-----

http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] is a popular text editor. Emacs ships in OS X.
