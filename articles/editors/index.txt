Setting up your editor to work with RubyMotion
==============================================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>

RubyMotion was designed so that developers do not need to switch to a particular editor or IDE in order to use it and can simply keep using the text editor they already know and love.

This article covers the text editors that provide support for RubyMotion. We try to keep this article up-to-date following the contributions from the community.

TextMate
--------

http://macromates.com/[TextMate] is a popular editor on OSX.

A https://github.com/libin/RubyMotion.tmbundle[RubyMotion.tmbundle] plugin is available. It provides code completion and an integration with the build system. It is developed by https://github.com/libin[Libin Pan] and https://github.com/berklee[Berklee].

Sublime Text
------------

http://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime Text] is a relatively new editor for OSX that is gaining a lot of interest.

https://github.com/haraken3/SublimeRubyMotionBuilder[SublimeRubyMotionBuilder] is a plugin that provides code completion and an integration with the build system. It is developed by https://github.com/haraken3[Kentaro Hara].

Redcar
------

Vim
---

http://www.vim.org/[Vim] is the most popular clone of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi[vi]. Vim ships in OSX. http://code.google.com/p/macvim/[MacVim] is a flavor of Vim for OSX that runs outside the terminal.

The builtin +rake ctags+ task can be used to generate a +tags+ file containing all the APIs the project can call into. This file can then be used to automatically complete API calls in the editor. RubyMotion uses http://ctags.sourceforge.net/[Exuberant Ctags]. Ctags is a format understood by a variety of text editors, Vim included.

Better auto-completion can be provided by using the SnipMate plugin by following https://gist.github.com/2652913[instructions], courtesy of https://github.com/shayarnett[Shay Arnett].

Emacs
-----

http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] is a popular text editor. Emacs ships in OSX.

It is possible to configure RubyMotion to emit a +tags+ file readable by Emacs by following the instructions in http://stirredbits.com/blog/2012/05/06/rubymotion-completion-with-emacs/[this article].
